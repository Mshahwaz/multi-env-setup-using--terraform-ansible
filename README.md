Project: Multi-Environment AWS Infrastructure Automation & Web Deployment

Architected and deployed a robust AWS infrastructure across multiple environments using EC2, S3, and DynamoDB for compute, storage, and database services.

Implemented Terraform IaC with remote state backends (S3 + DynamoDB lock) for team collaboration and state consistency.

Leveraged Ansible to automate server provisioning, configuring Nginx web servers with zero manual intervention.

Deployed a sample static web application on Nginx, ensuring smooth CI/CD-style workflow from infrastructure provisioning → configuration → application deployment.

Applied DevOps best practices (idempotent provisioning, reusable modules, version control) to achieve faster provisioning and maintainable infrastructure.
